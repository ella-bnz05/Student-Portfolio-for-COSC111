## Laboratory Activity 4

Objectives:

  1. Integrate the photoresistor in an Arduino circuit.
  2. Create a simple implementation of a light detection sensor.


Description:

This activity creates a light detection system using a photoresistor and an LED. The system monitors the brightness level and triggers the LED to blink if the brightness exceeds a predefined threshold.

To execute the program, first, diagram shown in A4-Diagram.png. Then, upload the code to the Arduino IDE, ensuring the correct port is selected. Finally, run the code to observe the light detection system. 

The components of the code that you need to understand are the following:
-Photoresistor (PHOTO_SENSOR_PIN): Detects the ambient light level.
-Brightness Threshold (BRIGHTNESS_THRESHOLD): The brightness level limit that triggers the LED activation.
